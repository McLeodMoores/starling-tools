OpenGamma Script utilities
--------------------------

This project provides tools for managing scripts.
It works in association with the opengamma-maven-plugin.

The concept is that the @Scriptable annotation is added to all suitable tool classes.
The ScriptGenerator can then be used to produce a set of script files based on templates.
