Starling M2E lifecycle mapping hack
------------------------------------
This is a hack to remove a warning from the command line build caused by m2e.
It simply allows a placeholder jar to be added to the McLeod Moores repository that blocks the warnings.
Without this dummy plugin, everyone sees this message:

```
[WARNING] The POM for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:jar:1.0.0 is missing, no dependency information available
[WARNING] Failed to retrieve plugin descriptor for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:1.0.0: Plugin org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:1.0.0 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: Failed to read artifact descriptor for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:jar:1.0.0
```
